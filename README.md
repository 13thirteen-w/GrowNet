# GrowNet code

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

The code is run in conda environment with the packages in requirements.txt file. The platform I used is linux-64.
You can create conda environment (assuming you already have miniconda3 installed) by the following command on terminal:

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
cudatoolkit=10.1.243 
numpy=1.18.1 
pandas=1.0.0 
python=3.6.10 
pytorch=1.4.0 
torchvision=0.5.0 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
conda create --name my_env --file requirements.txt
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
