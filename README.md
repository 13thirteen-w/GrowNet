# GrowNet code

The code is run in conda environment with the packages in requirements.txt file. The platform I used is linux-64.
You can create conda environment (assuming you already have miniconda3 installed) by the following command on terminal:


conda create --name my_env --file requirements.txt


The most important packages are followings:

cudatoolkit=10.1.243 

numpy=1.18.1 

pandas=1.0.0 

python=3.6.10 

pytorch=1.4.0 

torchvision=0.5.0
